CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Generate ONLY proper job interview questions that a hiring manager would ask a candidate
- Questions must be conversational and open-ended (e.g. "Tell me about...", "How would you...", "Describe a time when...")
- Do NOT reproduce any template fields, form fields, document sections, or structured data from the job description
- Do NOT generate questions that look like form fields or document templates
- Every question must end with a "?" and be something a human interviewer would verbally ask
- Focus on the candidate's skills, experience, problem-solving, and fit for the role

Generate exactly {num_questions} interview questions that:
1. Match the {difficulty} difficulty level
2. Test technical skills and experience relevant to the role
3. Include behavioral questions using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
4. Are clear, conversational, and specific
